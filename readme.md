The AI is fully functional now, but there are still things that need to be done.

 - Organize the code. Right now, the code is a mess. It needs to be broken up into seperate files, and also make a file that contains all of the constants, such as how many frames in the stack, how many frames to train, and the weights for the reward function.
 - Get it working on Linux 
 - Create a runtime editor so that we might be able to save and load models, change the reward function, and basically anything else that might be neccisary to get the accuracy up.
