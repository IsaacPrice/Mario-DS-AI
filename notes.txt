Not all states are equal, Some states happen more often than others.
The DQN will learn to estimate frequent states sooner thatn unfrequent ones.
If the DQN can reliably esimate the Q-values of a state, we explore less
if we can', we want to explore more.

Linear Layer:
y = w*x + b
y = (mew^w + sigma^w x epsilon^w)x + mew^b + sigma^b x epsilon^b
mew: mean of each of the parameters in w (weights of previous layers)
sigma: standard deviation of the parameters in w
epsilon: tensor of noise that we generate randomly

the bell curve that I was talking about was the prbability of the amount of noise added
look up standard deviation 1 graph

mew and sigma are learnable parameters
