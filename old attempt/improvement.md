Changing the architecture of a neural network mid-training is generally not straightforward, as the learned parameters (weights and biases) are specific to the architecture you started with. However, there are some strategies to adapt or improve an existing model:

### Ways to Adapt:

1. **Transfer Learning**: This is the closest to what you're asking. You can take the trained layers from your existing model and use them as the initial layers in a new, more complex model. You would have to train the new layers, but the existing ones should give you a head start. Note that this is generally easier if the new architecture is an extension of the old one (e.g., adding more layers).

2. **Fine-Tuning**: Sometimes just altering the learning rate, adding dropout for regularization, or changing the loss function can yield improvements without altering the architecture itself.

3. **Ensemble Methods**: You can train multiple models and have them vote on the best action to take. This won't improve any single model, but it might yield better overall performance.

### Ways to Improve:

1. **Experience Replay**: Store experiences and sample from this memory to train, which makes the learning process more stable and efficient.

2. **Prioritized Sampling**: Not all experiences are equally valuable for learning. Some might offer a rare but crucial piece of information.

3. **Reward Shaping**: Sometimes the reward function is the bottleneck, not the architecture.

### What Can be Changed at Runtime:

1. **Hyperparameters**: Things like learning rate can often be changed on-the-fly, although it's generally better to set them before training starts.

2. **Model Updates**: You can often update a deployed model with a newly trained one on the same architecture without too much trouble.

3. **Action Space**: The set of actions can sometimes be modified if your architecture is designed to accommodate that, although this would generally require re-training.

4. **Policy**: You could change the policy at runtime (e.g., from Îµ-greedy to a more exploitative policy) without changing the architecture.

Given your goals in AI and your ongoing learning, experimenting with these approaches could offer a lot of educational value. Just remember, improving an AI model is often an iterative process: train, evaluate, tweak, and train again.
